State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \\method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP.

This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%.

We generate 24,000 unsafe and synthetic spoken dialogues in English that consist of 3-10 turns, by having a single dialogue turn including content with one of 8 harmful categories (e.g., violence) and on one of 5 grades, from very mild to severe. On 160 dialogues, 5 human raters confirmed reliable unsafe detection and a meaningful severity scale. We benchmark three open-source LALMs: Qwen2-Audio, Audio Flamingo 3, and MERaLiON as zero-shot judges that output a scalar safety score in [0,1] across audio-only, transcription-only, or multimodal inputs, along with a transcription-only LLaMA baseline. We measure the judges' sensitivity to detecting unsafe content, the specificity in ordering severity levels, and the stability of the score in dialogue turns. Results reveal architecture- and modality-dependent trade-offs: the most sensitive judge is also the least stable across turns, while stable configurations sacrifice detection of mild harmful content.

Speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) offer an effective data augmentation strategy by transforming single-speaker recordings into realistic multi-speaker dialogues. However, prior work has primarily focused on English data, leaving questions about the applicability to lower-resource languages. In this paper, we adapt and implement the SASC framework for Hungarian conversational ASR. We further propose C-SASC, an extended variant that incorporates pause modeling conditioned on utterance duration, enabling a more faithful representation of local temporal dependencies observed in human conversation while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original approach. We generate synthetic Hungarian dialogues from the BEA-Large corpus and combine them with real conversational data for ASR training. Both SASC and C-SASC are evaluated extensively under a wide range of simulation configurations, using conversational statistics derived from CallHome, BEA-Dialogue, and GRASS corpora. Experimental results show that speaker-aware conversational simulation consistently improves recognition performance over naive concatenation-based augmentation. While the additional duration conditioning in C-SASC yields modest but systematic gains--most notably in character-level error rates--its effectiveness depends on the match between source conversational statistics and the target domain.

In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04722v1", "published": "2026-02-04T16:31:32Z", "authors": ["Gonçalo P.

LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility.

We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision.

URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations.

Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models.

We evaluate 14 open-source and frontier multimodal LMs, finding that even state-of-the-art models struggle on higher-level reasoning tasks such as structural segmentation and artist collaboration, while performing best on lyric transcription. Our analysis reveals that current models leverage linguistic priors effectively but remain limited in reasoning over musical structure, vocal, and musicological attributes. BASS provides an evaluation framework with widespread applications in music recommendation and search and has the potential to guide the development of audio LMs.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04085v1", "published": "2026-02-03T23:40:31Z", "authors": ["Min Jang", "Orevaoghene Ahia", "Nazif Tamer", "Sachin Kumar", "Yulia Tsvetkov", "Noah A.

Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04074v1", "published": "2026-02-03T23:22:37Z", "authors": ["Julius Fridriksson", "Roger D.

While AI models for H\\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\\% accuracy for location, 76.6\\% for intensity, and 75.7\\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\\% vs 68\\% for location, 70\\% vs 57\\% for intensity, 68\\% vs 52\\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $κ$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04063v1", "published": "2026-02-03T22:49:08Z", "authors": ["Jacob S.

{"source": "arxiv", "source_id": "arxiv_app", "title": "Fast, Unsupervised Framework for Registration Quality Assessment of Multi-stain Histological Whole Slide Pairs", "summary": "High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04046v1", "published": "2026-02-03T22:30:00Z", "authors": ["Shikha Dubey", "Patricia Raciti", "Kristopher Standish", "Albert Juan Ramon", "Erik Ames Burlingame"], "fetched_at": "2026-02-05T16:11:48.634778+00:00"}

However, much of everyday emotional support needs occur in non-clinical contexts, and therefore requires different conversational approaches. We examine how chaplains, who guide individuals through personal crises, grief, and reflection, perceive and engage with conversational AI. We recruited eighteen chaplains to build AI chatbots. While some chaplains viewed chatbots with cautious optimism, the majority expressed limitations of chatbots' ability to support everyday well-being. Our analysis reveals how chaplains perceive their pastoral care duties and areas where AI chatbots fall short, along the themes of Listening, Connecting, Carrying, and Wanting. These themes resonate with the idea of attunement, recently highlighted as a relational lens for understanding the delicate experiences care technologies provide. This perspective informs chatbot design aimed at supporting well-being in non-clinical contexts.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04017v1", "published": "2026-02-03T21:04:49Z", "authors": ["Joel Wester", "Samuel Rhys Cox", "Henning Pohl", "Niels van Berkel"], "fetched_at": "2026-02-05T16:11:48.634922+00:00"}

This remains a major computational bottleneck as existing tools either rely on inaccurate heuristic thresholding for tissue detection, or adopt AI-based approaches trained on limited-diversity data that operate at the patch level, incurring substantial computational complexity. We present AtlasPatch, an efficient and scalable slide preprocessing framework for accurate tissue detection and high-throughput patch extraction with minimal computational overhead. AtlasPatch's tissue detection module is trained on a heterogeneous and semi-manually annotated dataset of ~30,000 WSI thumbnails, using efficient fine-tuning of the Segment-Anything model. The tool extrapolates tissue masks from thumbnails to full-resolution slides to extract patch coordinates at user-specified magnifications, with options to stream patches directly into common image encoders for embedding or store patch images, all efficiently parallelized across CPUs and GPUs. We assess AtlasPatch across segmentation precision, computational complexity, and downstream multiple-instance learning, matching state-of-the-art performance while operating at a fraction of their computational cost.
